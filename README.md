<h3 align="center">CMS Connect App for Wordpress
</h3>

VueFront is a <a href="//vuejs.org">Vue-powered</a> agnostic frontend web app for your old fashioned Blog and Ecommerce site. 

Wordpress is open source software you can use to create a beautiful website, blog, or app.

CMS Connect App - adds the connection between the Wordpress CMS and VueFront WebApp via a GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
This is a wordpress plugin that connects the wordpress CMS with the VueFront WebApp via a GraphQL API. When installed, you will be provided with a CMS Connect URL that you will add to your VueFront WebApp .env file.  

## DEMO

[VueFront](https://wordpress.vuefront.com/)

[Admin](https://wordpress.vuefront.com/admin)

### Wordpress Store (WooCommerce) 
Since Wordpress does not have a built-in Store, we use the [Free WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) to add store support. If woocommerce is not avalible, VueFront will ignore it.

## How to install?

### Quick Install
1. The quickest way to install is via [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/vuefront/) or manually [Download](https://github.com/vuefront/wordpress/releases) the **compiled** plugin and upload it through the 'Plugins > Add New' menu in WordPress
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit plugin's settings to get the CMS Connect URL

You will need the CMS Connect URL to complete the [VueFront Web App installation](https://vuefront.com/guide/setup.html)
